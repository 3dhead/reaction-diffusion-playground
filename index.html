  <h1>Reaction-diffusion experiments</h1>

  <p>Reaction-diffusion is a grid-based process that generates complex and dynamic patterns based the interactions of two chemicals as they diffuse through a medium and react with one another. At every location on the grid these chemicals (usually referred to as A and B) have a chance of causing a reaction that converts chemicals of one type to another based on their relative concentrations at that location.</p>

  <p>Throughout the simulation chemical A is added at a particular feed rate (f) and chemical B is removed at a particular kill rate (k) - adjusting these rates can result in wildly different emergent patterns.</p>
